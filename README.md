# Code for the Paper -- The Impact of Social Nudges on User-Generated Content for Social Network Platforms
Here the authors provide the code used in the paper, [*The Impact of Social Nudges on User-Generated Content for Social Network Platforms*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3611571). You could contact the authors if you have any questions.

All the code used to obtain the results in this paper is disclosed here. However, the authors are not allowed to reveal any datasets, as required by the platform which they collaborated with. Nevertheless, to help other scholars better understand the context and insights of this research, the authors have made an effort on data disclosure, and in the [online appendix of this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3611571), they report the distributional information of the features and outcome variables studied in the paper, as well as that of the degrees of the sample network used in the paper.

## Files
Here, the authors provide two files written by Python:
1. Empirical_Analyses.py
  - This file records the code to conduct empirical analyses about the experiments (e.g., Sections 4--5, and parameters estimation in Section 6). The empirical analyses focus on how to obtain the reduced-form causal effects of social nudges. Comments are added to to match code with tables and figures. 
3. Simulation_Analyses.py
  - This file records the code related to the social network model (Section 6), which includes calculating the overall effect of social nudges on production over the entire network in a long-term steady state, and solving the operational problems regarding social nudges. Comments are added to to match code with tables and figures.
